1.) Palindrome program here.
2.) For palindromes, an array is better because checking by index is easier. With a linked list, checking for a palindrome will be unnecessarily hard to implement and checking by index is not as efficient in linked lists.
3.) Circular linked list program here.
4.) Circular linked list would be better because no shifting is needed and when the ending is reached you can simply just use a pointer to the start.
